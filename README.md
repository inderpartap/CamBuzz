Headquartered in VIT Chennai, Cambuzz began as a side project and is now a tiny, bootstrapped idea helping the VIT Chennai family to share their events and is trying to become a go-to resource for discovering and connecting with everyone in the campus. Cambuzz can be divided into three sections:

- Buzz around - Post all events happening near you.
- Track teacher - Know when in the right time to meet your teacher.
- Ask questions - Solve your problems. Get answers right away.

## Dedication

In our first year of our undergrad, we felt that we are at a disadvantage in terms of exposure compared. People can only work hard if they know what opportunities and validation they can get after their undergrad. Problems related to exposure ranged from big problems like not knowing about various different job opportunities other than IT (which is currently the norm), prospects in research, generating entrepreneurial spirit amongst the students to social problems like where can girls buy sanitary pads safely? We also wanted to develop a senior-junior interaction without the risk of ragging, because it is the seniors who set examples for juniors. Most of the students wake up in their junior year so as to what to do after their undergrad, and if we could quantify time with motivation which could lead to effectively planning undergraduate education, we could give rise to a movement of in our college.

We realised that lot of complications in the existing education system arise due to the lack of awareness and is a manifestation of one core problem: effective communication. So we developed Cambuzz: a one-stop campus networking tool. We targeted 3 problems:

- Senior-Junior Interaction: Q/A forum for students to put questions and get answers. 
- Track Teacher: Network with teachers outside of class. Also frugal details like free slot's, cabin number, research interests for easy discovery.
- Buzz: Get to know about the events happening in the campus.
